# Internationalization (I18N) - Language Translations

## Overview

This document provides a brief overview of changes needed when adding new languages to DataFormsJS. Three different repositories need to be updated for full site translations.

The following setup is recommended for local development.

~~~
dataformsjs    {root-directory}
├── dataformsjs  [repository]
├── playground   [repository]
└── website      [repository]
~~~

If you need to install PHP see documents for (Windows, macOS, and Linux) from: https://www.fastsitephp.com/en/getting-started

Currently specific languages are desired and translation work can be paid. For more see: https://www.fastsitephp.com/en/translators-needed

Files are copied from English, Google Translate is used for initial translations, and then human translators fix errors from Google Translate.

## Generating the files

All needed files can be generated by using the php script once all 3 repositories are downloaded:

https://github.com/dataformsjs/website/blob/master/scripts/create-i18n-files.php

Simply change the value for [const LANG_COPY_TO = '{lang}';] on line 18 and run it.

## JSON Files

Files for specific languages end with `*.{lang}.json` and the main files for the main site is `_.{lang}.json`.

* `dataformsjs\examples\i18n`
* `website\public\i18n`

See line #5: `data-i18n-locales="en,..."`. Once all JSON files are created copy the full text for the [data-i18n-locales] attribute and then find/replace globally in all files using a Code Editor. As of 12/2019 there are 30 instances in 12 files.

In the main file above search for `i18n-menu` and add the new language so it shows on the nav menus. There are two locations (one for desktop and one for mobile). Also search for `app.plugins.i18n.currentLocale` and make needed changes so the language links to the translated GitHub readme.

For React Files search for `const supportedLocales =` and then add the language to the array. As of 12/2019 there are 2 files that need to be updated.

The order of languages for the Nav Menu will be initially based on global internet usage for each language; however this may change in the future:

# Code Playground Template

Each language has it's own template directory/folder. Once a directory is created for a language then it can be used for to create sites. Text content and code comments are updated to the translated language.

`playground\app_data\template\{lang}`

## Main Site Readme

Some of this content is duplicated from the main home page so some content simply be copied after translating JSON files.

`dataformsjs\docs\i18n-readme\README.{lang}.md`

https://github.com/dataformsjs/dataformsjs/tree/master/docs/i18n-readme

## Quick Reference Code

Code comments are updated to the translated language.
