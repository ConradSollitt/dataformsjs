**** Priority Items Start
****

*) Update docs with new instructions to use GitHub Repositories for downloading site content rather than S3
    website\docs\Main Site Server Setup.txt
    playground\docs\Playground Server Setup.txt
    website\docs\Python Webserver Setup for AI_ML Functions.txt

*) Playground\README.md
    - Add a [How it works] and link to the FastSitePHP version with some notes on differences

*) Link CDN page to the main DataFormsJS site and update colors/theme on it
    https://d2xbd92kui7v97.cloudfront.net/index.html

*) Finish testing all pages on many different devices and browsers
    Will be done over the next week
    - Known Issues:
        - Home page animation is broken in IE 11 and Edge
            Possibly due to recent changes for nested <tspan> elements
        - Firefox Home Page Icons do not scale correctly
        - Try smaller font size for code examples on mobile devices
        - Nav Menu on AI/ML Demos for narrow screens/phones
        - Image: https://www.dataformsjs.com/img/examples/ai-ml-image-classification.svg
            Does not show correctly in Safari due to SVG Brightness filter.
            Come up with a fix for a browsers or remove the filter and
            manually calculate the needed values.

*) Use preconnect optiomization? Need to test how will it improves preformance from different locations in the world.
    <link href="https://playground.dataformsjs.com" rel="preconnect" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://ai-ml.dataformsjs.com" rel="preconnect" crossorigin>

*) Add shortcut icons on the main site for different mobile devices

*) React <JsonData> and Web Components <json-data>
    - Support for custom Request Headers is needed. For React this will likely be passed as a new prop
    - For how the standard Framework handles this see code related to [app.settings.requestHeaders].

*) Allow optional caching for Web  Component <json-data>
    similar to the standard [pages/jsonData.js] and React <JsonData>. To see how this works use
    dev tools with one of the following demos:
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-hbs#/en/
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-vue#/en/
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-graphql#/en/
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-react.htm#/en/
    The standard [jsonData.js] uses properties [loadOnlyOnce] and [submittedFetchUrl]
    for this while React code uses [JsonData] and [const dataCache = [];]

**** Priority Items End
****

*) Improve UX of the Quick Ref Page
    https://www.dataformsjs.com/#/en/quick-reference
    - Filtering on all code doesn't work well due to generic terms "JavaScript" "Template", "Vue", etc
        Too many items are returned
    - Likely use a topic based list where the user can click and view one code block at a time
        The topic list itself can be filtered
    - Needs to work well and look good for both mobile and desktop
    - May use new hash url:
        "#/:lang/quick-reference/:topic"
        However all code should be downloaded only once and displayed in memory

*) Many Docs need to be created along with API page(s)
    - API needs a quick search/filter feature to look up any attribute/class/function/etc
        and find where it is defined and how to use it.
    - UI/UX still needs to be decided on for API docs

*)  Create an [I18N] API for Web Components and initially use with:
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-web
    - API is not yet started on so it has be decided first
    - Possibly several development versions will be created and tested
      with the best one selected

*) Need ESLint and JSHint config files - will have to be directory by directory since one directory
    may contain Modules while another ECMA Version 5. Currently code hints and comments are used.
    Additionally some directories [react/web-components] need overrides on specific files
    - A recent ESLint changed added a check that breaks validation when using copy/paste from
      a broswer. Disable in needed files by adding. Currently done in the main [DataFormsJS.js] file.
        /* eslint no-prototype-builtins: "off" */

*) Create Search Screen for the following pages:
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-vue#/en/
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-web
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-react#/en/
   See standard framework demos with Handlebars:
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-hbs#/en/
        http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-graphql#/en/
   Start with Vue because it uses the Standard framework
   This will likely require new or updated pluigns for Vue and new classes for React

*) Most Core Framework Code in [DataForms.js] and [pages/jsonData.js] are Unit Tested for
        Handlebars, Nunjucks, and Underscore, however similar testing has not yet been
        started on for Vue. Additional Unit Tests need to be developed for sperate
        React Components and Web Components.
    - Overall every line of code needs to be tested for core files

*) Create Server-side Starter Sites in all widely used Languages and Frameworks
    - Include ability for content to be defined server-side and saved to a SQLite Db

*) React JSX Loader?
    This is being considered and would take some time to develop. Basically a JavaScript file
    would be created <script src="jsxLoader.js"> which would check if a modern browser is being
    used and if so then simply convert JSX code to modern JS and if a legacy browser (IE, old safari, etc)
    then it would load and use babel standalone.
    - The reason for this would be to allow JSX development for production sites without
      a build process using [create-react-app], Webpack, etc.
    - babel standalone works but is very large, however it would be ok for desktop IE users, etc
    - If doing this the code to compile or transpile JSX to JS needs to be kept small, ideally
      the entire file would be less than a few hunderd lines and only a few kb in size when gzip'd
    - the script should also define needed [window.exports = window; / function require(module) {)]
      functions to be used by babel standalone or JS
    - It's likley that an alternative router component <UrlHashRouter> will be created with this
      that can be used instead of React Router. The reason is that a much smaller component
      can be created and the main reason would be to add support for lazy-loading of scripts
      similar to the main framework for [app.lazyLoad] and [data-lazy-load]. This feature would
      probably be shared with the new [jsxLoader.js] file.
    - To test in the Playground:
        - Copy all code from [JsonData.js] locally, then make changes:
            Comment out or remove:
                // import React from 'react';
            Add to file:
                window.JsonData = JsonData;
        - From main page [app-react.htm] use:
            <script type="module" src="JsonData.js"></script>
        - Basically the current es6 code works from a browser but needs a global export
          and 'import React' removed. This should be handled by the [jsxLoader.js] file.

*) Web Components Polyfill using either the main Framework or standalone scripts?
    - Currently IE, Older Safari, etc will display a warning message instead of Polyfill for Web Components
    - Polyfills will be considered (and likely developed in the future) for Web Components but they
        would need a full re-write and not using babel, etc. For an example of why see:
            DataFormsJS\js\web-components\utils.js
                export function componentsAreDefined
                export function componentsAreSetup
        - Basically DataFormsJS Web Components are not going to be held back by the need for ES5
    - Currently the main framework has <json-data> and <data-table> JavaScript controls
        that are similar to the <json-data> and <data-table> Web Component. These could be changed
        and additional code developed to match the behavior of Web Components.
    - Alternatively indivivual files such as [DataFormsJS\js\web-components\polyfill\json-data.js]
        could be developed. Currenlty in favor of using the standard Framework as a it would handle
        a lot of the need for web components.
    - If using the standard framework then [url-hash-router] would need to be polyfilld as well,
        either from the main file [DataFormsJS.js] or a new file [js/controls/url-hash-router.js].
        This would be determined during development based on what makes sense.
    - Using the main framework would be preferred to reduce additional duplicate code and because
        when gzipped the framework is small (9.6 kb for version 1.0.0).

*) React Build:
    - Convert http://127.0.0.1:8080/jsx-build to a build page on the main site
    - Many options will be needed on how to build:
        - which components and classes
        - babel options?
        - Include or exclude [DataFormsJS] namespace object
    - Similar to how the prismjs download works:
        https://prismjs.com/download.html

*) Docs and demos to Create
    - Cleanup [DataFormsJS\examples\handlebars-helpers.htm] and add to to the main
        examples page. Also create a similar [vue-directives.htm] file.
        - For cleanup likely add a new plugin [refreshOnTimer] to refresh the page
          on a defined interval from the HTML controller.
        - Need to demonstrate all Handlebars Helpers such as {{#ifJS}}
    - Framework Event Order (note - Vue varies slightly)
        ====================================================
        Page Event Order when a URL Changes:
        ------
        plugins.onRouteUnload()
        controller.onRouteUnload(model as this)
        plugins.onRouteLoad(next)
        controller.onRouteLoad(model as this)
        ... Then code below:
        --------------------------------------------------
        Event Order for when app.updateView() is called.
        This can happen multiple times per URL/Hash Change:
        ------
        controller.onBeforeRender(model as this)
        plugins.onBeforeRender()
        -- HTML Template Rendered --
        -- HTML Controls Rendered --   Elements with [data-template-id] or [data-template-url]
        -- JS Controled Loaded -- Custom JS Controls defined by [js/controls]
        plugins.onRendered()
        controller.onRendered(model as this)
        app.onUpdateViewComplete()  # Global event - typically for Unit Testing only
        ====================================================
    - Getting Started Page
        - See comments in: [Website\public\js\page-getting-started.js] under [viewTemplate.onclick]
            Templates should possibly be rendered from PHP server-side. FastSitePHP has
            and I18N API that is similar to DataFormsJS so it would be easy to convert.
        - Likely add a regions page that is downloaded from CDN, this would also need to handle
            translations so server-side code would help here
    - If using Vue then document and show examples of which controller functions are called
        by which Vue events - search [DataForms.js] for "new Vue".
        - Example [Controlller.onRouteLoad] is called by [Vue.mounted]
    - Vue - [app.activeVueModel] can be used but not on the first [onRendered], apps should use [this]
    - How to use custom events for <url-hash-router> and <json-data>
      See comments in JS code at bottom of:
        DataFormsJS\examples\places-demo-web.htm
    - How to use Authorization and various options, see example in [DataFormsJS\examples\entry-form-demo-hbs.htm]
    - Document with an example of why most event listener functions should be defined
      in seperate named functions outside of [addEventListener]. For example if
      an anonymous function is added and the plugin is called multiple times on
      the same element then multiple functions would be called. Example [clickToHighlight]
      uses [toggleHighlight()], if not used and [app.plugins.clickToHighlight.onRendered()]
      were called several times then it performs the same action several times.
    - How to use [app.loadScript()], example:
            var url = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@2.9.2/dist/Chart.min.js';
            app.loadScript(window.Chart, url, callback);
        or:
            app.loadScript(window.Chart, url).then(function() {
                // Code for Chart
            });
        To load script 1st Parameter needs to be [false] or [undefined]:
            (window.Promise && window.fetch ? true : false)
            window.fetch
    - How [app.lazyLoad], [data-lazy-load] and [app.loadScripts] works, for starting point
      see comments in:
        DataFormsJS\examples\places-demo-hbs.htm
    - How to setup a local development - create the following folders, download needed files to them,
      then comment out CDN links and uncomment the vendor links.
        DataFormsJS\vendor
        DataFormsJS\test\vendor\qunit
    - Examples in the [js/templates/*] such as [page-object.js] will likely be moved to documentation
        pages and the template files more minimal with only [console.log()] on the events.
        In the future there should be unit tests for the [js/templates/*] files.
    - Custom Controls, for example usage see [DataFormsJS\examples\js-control-demos-hbs.htm]
        That file can be a starting point to see code for how to build custom controls.
        In the future there should also be one or more [DataFormsJS\js\templates\*.js] files
        for custom controls.
    - Need demos for Handlebar Helpers, Vue Directives and React Format class
    - All Parameters for I18N Files and Classes, example for React:
        const defaultLocale = 'en';
        const supportedLocales = ['en', 'jp'];
        const fileName = 'countries';
        const fileDir = 'http://localhost:3000/i18n';
        const i18n = new I18n(defaultLocale, supportedLocales, fileName, fileDir);
    - Document different build options that can be used
        Uglify-js https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js
        Google Closure Compiler https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/
        Estimated Gzip size  https://github.com/sindresorhus/gzip-size-cli

    - How to delay a loading screen for a specific time through CSS, see example in:
        Website\public\html\getting-started\getting-started.css
    - MNIST Keras/TensorFlow demo with JS Plugin to allow user to draw number
    - How to replicate embedded page links using hash URL:
        Normally <a href="#target"> would work to link to:
            <div id="target">
        However because SPA hash routing is used App would redict to another page
        Example work-around:
            <a href="javascript:document.getElementById('target').scrollIntoView();window.scrollTo(0, window.pageYOffset-100);">
        In the future this could be make into a generic plugin. The [window.scrollTo()] is used above to handle
        a fixed header in a specific app.
    - Show difference between jQuery, Object.assign() and app.deepClone() in a doc
        jQuery adds to an array rather than replace it
			var data = { a:[ {o1:1}, {o2:2}, {o3:3}, {o4:4} ] }
			$.extend(true, data, { a:[ {o1:'a'}, {o2:'b'}, {o3:'c'} ] })
		Then:
			data = { a:[ {o1:'a'}, {o2:'b'}, {o3:'c'}, {o4:4}  ] }
			- Issue with jQuery Deep Clone [o4] is still kept which results in
              in unexpected results for the Json Data Services (page.jsonData, <JsonData>, etc)
		Compare with:
			Object.assign(true, data, { a:[ {o1:'a'}, {o2:'b'}, {o3:'c'} ] })
			app.deepClone(data, { a:[ {o1:'a'}, {o2:'b'}, {o3:'c'} ] })
		Show this as a more practical example (real records in an array)

		# Object.assign() works but will set a ref to original nested array
        var data = { a:[1,2,3] }
        var data2 = Object.assign({}, data)
			# compare with: [var data2 = app.deepClone({}, data)]
        data2.a === data.a
        data.a.push(4)
        data2.a.indexOf(4)

*) [Website\public\sitemap.xml]
    In the future this file will be generated as more languages are added.
    Rather than including all examples one language for each demo is selected (a mix of Handlebars, Vue, React, Web Components)
    and some examples are excluded such as the log demo and entry form demo since they only include random data and no info.

*) AI/ML Demos
    - Add links back to Python server code and JS Client code once published on Github
    - Text Content and layout of info tabs can be improved:
        http://localhost:3000/examples/image-classification-vue.htm#/en/info
        http://localhost:3000/examples/binary-classification-hbs.htm#/en/info
        - SVG Graphics, more organized, etc
    - Add an option to paste image from clipboard in addition to the file selection
    - Image classification - If needed (for example, too many people use the demo at the same time)
          added a [maxFiles = 30] property to limit the number of uploads at one time
        - either show user a [confirm()] or simply show a custom element.
        - JS Comments can mention that it can be changed manually for (Hbs/Vue) be
          using DevTools with [app.activeModel.maxFiles = 100]
        - This will be decided later based on site usage.
        - Likely if many people use to to play with more low cost servers behind
          a load balancer will be added.
    - Possibly combine to a single demo and add more AI/ML examples such as Object Detection

*) Add scripts to launch unit tests or examples using the users default browser.
    - The scripts can be then added to [package.json]
    - For Unit Testing likely use a puppeteer script

*) Playground Page
    - Optimization - stop/start the timers based on if the tab is active or not?
        https://webkit.org/blog/8970/how-web-content-can-affect-power-usage/
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API
    - Add CodeMirror support for GraphQL
        At the time of writing GraphQL is not a built-in mode for CodeMirror:
            https://codemirror.net/mode/index.html
        Instead Facebook uses their own custom mode and it requires a custom build process and not CDN, see:
            https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/master/packages/codemirror-graphql

*) DataFormsJS\js\React\PolyfillService.jsx
    - Allow the polyfill URL to be optionally passed via a prop

*) DataFormsJS\js\React\jsPlugins.js
    How to handle [Plugin.onRouteUnload()]? Not yet needed with common framework plugins but needed
    for future plugins that use [window.setInterval] or [window.setTimeout]

*) DataFormsJS\js\Plugins\highlighter.js
    - Allow users to define text results such as "{count} Records matched [{value}]"
    - Need ability to handle multiple langauges

*) todomvc Example
    - Possibly publish it as a seperate Repository with notes on how to copy?
    - Or keep core files with notes on how to install?
    - Future - run unit tests against it:
        https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/tests

*) Add unit tests for momentjs with handlebars - or add to a seperate page?
    - Originally it was included but has been removed from the initial release:
            <div id="moment-01">{{moment (now) "YYYY.MM.DD"}}</div>
            <div id="moment-02">{{moment dateTime "YYYY.MM.DD, h:mm:ss A"}}</div>
            { id: "moment-01", value: (new Date()).getFullYear(), type: "contains" },
            { id: "moment-02", value: "2015.01.31, 1:23:45 PM" },

*) Chosen Plugin, need examples or docs showing how callbacks from [app.events.on] are used

*) New [data-format] Plugin?
    - Could it be used with <data-table> for Columns?
    - Or should this also be build into the <data-table> Control? Examples:
        data-col-align-left="col1, col2"
        data-col-format-number="col1, col2"
    - Initial testing could be done with the [places-demo-js] example

*) Entry Form Demo [entry-form-demo]
    - Impore layout
    - Add an info page on how it works
    - Add a new date field and then create an use a plugin for [pickadate]
        https://amsul.ca/pickadate.js/
        This will require including jQuery on the page. Both jQuery and pickadate
        should be hosted using a CDN.
    - Add a seperate line item table for the main records to demonstrate how
        [EntryForm.js], [ListEditor.js] can be used to edit related records.
        line item table will go on a seperate tab on the main screen then
        list screens will simply report on how many records exist per record.

*) Log Demo [log-table-hbs.htm], [log-table-vue.htm], etc
    - move <h1>, and <nav> outside of the render section so that they do not flash
        when cleared from each screen. Would need to make sure the [clear filter]
        button doesn't get set multiple times.
        Also possibly do this for the <input filter> control.

*) Web Components
    - All web components are stable but in early development, many features needed
    - Lazy Loading of scripts when using <url-hash-router>
        - will work similar to the framework [app.lazyLoad] and [data-lazy-load]
        - possibly use [window.lazyLoad = {}] to define all lazy load scripts
        - existing demos such as [places-demo-web.htm] then need to be updated to load scripts only when used
    - <i18n-service> outside of the hash router or <i18n-service url-params> under the hash router.
        How to do something like this with <data-table>?
            <a href="#/{{../i18n_Locale}}/regions/{{iso}}">
        Possibly:
            col-link-template="#/:window.i18n_Locale/regions/:iso"
        Another option if using <i18n-service> outside of the hash router could be to define
        [i18n-key="value"] attributes on elements that <i18n-service> would update.
        The <i18n-service> then might have to use JS code such as the following to handle updates
            document.querySelector('url-hash-router').addEventListener('contentLoaded')
            await componentsAreDefined(document)]
        Likely try several versions to see what makes the most sense
    - Likely create <handlebars-template> and <vue-template>
        - It will then use a [get value()] and [set value(data)] like the [data-table.js]
            so that the model can be passed to it. It should then cache the renderd <script>
            element inside of it and render it in the <*-template> block.
        - Setting a new value will re-render the template.
        - If windows.Handlebars or windows.Vue is undefined then they should be downloaded from a CDN
        - Possible example:
            <url-hash-router>
                <url-hash-route path="/:lang/regions/:country">
                    <json-data
                        url="http://localhost:3000/html/data/geonames/regions/:country"
                        url-params>

                        <is-loaded>
                            <handlebars-template data-bind>
                                <script type="text/x-template">
                                    {{#each countries}}
                                    {{/each}}
                                </script>
                            </handlebars-template>
                        </is-loaded>
                    </json-data>
                </url-hash-route>
            </url-hash-router>
    - [web-components\utils.js] possibly add more generic functions from the main [DataForms.js]
      for example [showErrorAlert()]
    - web-components\json-data.js
        - Create a similar [graphql-data.js] file and class for GraphQL support.
            It will behave similar to [json-data.js] and include features from the standard [pages/jsonData.js].
        - Allow override of default [fetch()] options
        - Need specific usage documentation, example:
            Child elements <is-loading>, <has-error>, <is-loaded> all quickly
            flash unless the custom css [json-data:not(:defined)...] is included.
            - Currently demo page has comments.
    - web-components\data-table.js
        - Add ability to define user defined error messages, labels, etc;
            simlar to the [Controls\data-table.js] file. Handle these with
            custom html attributes.
        - Need ability to format data, possible options:
            data-format-date="col1, col2"
            data-format-cols="col1:date, col2:number"
            data-format-cols="0:bool, 1:datetime"  # also by index
            also custom labels for bool values such as "yes" or "no"
        - Related the standard Framework JS Control <data-table> will need a similar update
            Formatting needed:
                http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-web
                http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-js#/en/
            Formatting works:
                http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-hbs#/en/
                http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-graphql#/en/
                http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-react#/en/
                http://127.0.0.1:8080/places-demo-vue#/en/
    - Come up with a good method for formatting numbers, dates, etc. With Vue the standard
        Framework provides the directive [v-format-number] and for Handlebars there are
        Handlebars helpers such as [formatNumber]. Similar functionality is needed for web components,
        however at the time of writing there is no custom web attribute API to use.
    - See example [places-demo-web.htm]
        - DataFormsJS\examples\html\place-web.htm
            <i class="[place.country_code] flag" data-bind-attr="class"></i>
                does not work because [place.country_code] needs to be lowercase
            [place.ascii_name] should only show if it is different then [place.name]
            [is="input-filter"] should only show if [place.alternate_names.length > 10]
            Date and Number Formatting, Calculations for [place.elevation]
        - Because most other demos use templating, react, vue the above items are handled.
          Should they be handled by the Web Components? If so it can add a lot of code
          and make them more complex.
        - An alternative to making the web components more complex would be to use the planned
            <handlebars-template> and <vue-template>

*) Create seperate JSX files based on React Components in a new folder for Preact?
   Or can the current React Components be used?
    https://preactjs.com/

*) GraphQL
    - Add GraphQL support on [pages/entryForm.js]
    - Add support for other GraphQL types such as Float.
        Currently only Strings and Ints are supported, see:
        https://graphql.org/graphql-js/basic-types/
        - Related Code:
            app.buildGraphQLVariables()
    - Can the file [app\app.js] be easily updated to avoid using "SELECT *"
        on SQL queries and get only the requested fields. Only do this if it
        doesn't take too much code because the file is meant to be a simple
        and readable demo. See the following link:
        https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-demystifying-the-info-argument-in-graphql-resolvers-6f26249f613a
    - Add GET support for GraphQL in:
        DataFormsJS\js\controls\json-data.js
      See how it can be done from:
        DataFormsJS\js\pages\jsonData.js
      When adding a demo page needs to be created to test

*) Create pluings and examples for popular JS libraries
    https://www.chartjs.org/
    http://ckeditor.com/
    https://www.tiny.cloud/
    https://codemirror.net/
    Many, many more

*) Demo Pages
    - Use a page to show summary data on charts, example
        Pie Chart with Population by Continent
    - Geonames Data Service that shows Country Names in User's local langauge
    - Entry Form Demo
        Add a related detail record tab and show in a tab for the main record.
        It will be used to show how the [listEditor.js] works with a main record.
    - Places demo
        Add versions for Nunjucks and Underscore templating but likely exclude
        from the home page and just show in the examples section. Nunjucks and
        Underscore will need either a future [data-format] plugin or other code
        updates to handle date and number formatting.

*) Number and Date/Time formatting for all demos [places-demo-*]
    - Needed on JS and Web Components demos

*) Support for HTML Pushstate
    - First create a web component <url-pushstate-router> based on <url-hash-router>
    - Then later add to the main framework if it makes sense too
    - If adding to the main framework the code should be kept small

*) Create Unit Tests for Vue
    This will be similar to the main unit test files for each template,
    however there will be many differences so it will take some time to create this.

    To track when controller/plugins are called modify and use this:
    app.onUpdateViewComplete = function(source) { console.log(source); };

*) Possible Updates for Vue
    SPA is currently required for Vue
    Example Non-SPA demo [DataFormsJS\examples\countries-no-spa-hbs.htm]
    currently cannot be converted to Vue

*) Create Unit Tests for the following functions:
    Controller.onRouteUnload

*) Fix unit tests for IE 11
    Originally all unit tests worked but not some are not working
    Some logic such as was added:
        if (!isIE) {
    Additionally some tests related to JS Controls are broken however JS controls are confirmed with work with IE
    when using: http://127.0.0.1:8080/js-control-demos-hbs#/

*) Additional Unit Testing for the following functions, props, etc:
    data-engine:
        Validate error message in [app.setup()] at [(viewEngine === ViewEngines.Unknown)]
        This will be similar to the unit test for "template-invalid-path"
    app.deepClone() - Test with getter/setter props
    app.loadScript()
    [app.lazyLoad] and all related features including [app.loadScripts]
        See additional comments in next item below
    app.loadJsControl(), examples
        - verify [app.activeJsControls[n].data] objects
        - manually call and recall [app.loadJsControl()]
    app.unloadAllJsControls()
        - manually test before a route is unloaded or when page is called with updateView
    [data-default-route] used to specify default route from script element (used on the main web site)
    app.locals
    controller.settings
        - using Arrays, Objects, etc
    Event Order for manual calls to [refreshHtmlControl()] and [refreshAllHtmlControls()]
        and how they call [refreshPlugins()] and [loadAllJsControls()].
        This can probably be checked in test "Route Change and Event Order"
        - Parmas should be tested for these functions as well
    addPlugin(name, function)
        Currently only [addPlugin(name, object)] is validated
    addPage() and addController()
        When creating Unit Tests for Vue these two functions should exclude the function [onBeforeRender]
        from validation in case a controller only defines that function. When using Vue [onBeforeRender()]
        is not called - low priority updated needed in [DataForms.js] for this
    app.setttings.getRequestHeaders
        - Example:
            app.settings.requestHeaders = { "X-Test-Header": "Test123", "X-Test2": "ABC" };
            app.settings.requestHeadersByHostName = { localhost: { "X-Test-Header": "123456789" }};
            app.getRequestHeaders("http://localhost/test");
            app.getRequestHeaders("https://www.example.com/");
    Test paramaters for all [apply(app.activeModel, app.activeParameters)] code
    app.handleGlobalErrors()
    <templates> = [display:none] for IE but not other browsers
    plugin.onRouteLoad
    Create a seperate page for testing features if no controllers are included on a page
        verify that plungins run, etc
    data-set-text-content
    app.getTemplateType()
        Error under [(script.tagName !== 'TEMPLATE' && script.tagName !== 'SCRIPT')] is not tested
    CSS Error Styles that were added after Unit Tests were initially created:
        '.dataformsjs-error,.dataformsjs-fatal-error{',
            'white-space:pre;',
            'text-align:left;',


*) Update for previous Unit Tests that changed when [app.lazyLoad] as added.
    - Before [app.lazyLoad] the pages had to be defined when controllers were added
      so this code was included under [DataFormsJS.js -> addController()]
        if (controller.pageType !== null && controller.pageType !== undefined) {
            ...
            validateObjectExists(this.pages[controller.pageType], 'app.pages.' + controller.pageType, funcName);
            validateTypeOf(this.pages[controller.pageType].model, 'object', 'app.pages.' + controller.pageType + '.model', funcName);
    - And the following were tested in [unit-testing.js]:
            try {
                expectedMessage = "[app.pages.MissingPage] must first be defined before the function app.addController(path=Test) is called";
                app.addController({ path: "Test", pageType: "MissingPage" });
                assert.ok(false, "Test should have failed");
            } catch (e) {
                assert.ok(e instanceof TypeError, "Execption should be a TypeError");
                assert.equal(e.message, expectedMessage, expectedMessage);
            }

            try {
                //First add an invalid page manually without using app.addPage()
                //This error would happen if the developer overwrites a page object
                //as a invalid type or if they manually add an invalid page.
                app.pages.InvalidPage = { model: function () { return ""; } };
                tester.pagesCount++;

                //Run the test
                expectedMessage = "[app.pages.InvalidPage.model] was not defined as a object when the function app.addController(path=Test) was called";
                app.addController({ path: "Test", pageType: "InvalidPage" });
                assert.ok(false, "Test should have failed");
            } catch (e) {
                assert.ok(e instanceof TypeError, "Execption should be a TypeError");
                assert.equal(e.message, expectedMessage, expectedMessage);
            }
    - That validation is now handled in [function setControllerFromPage(controller)] with the following code
			if (app.pages[controller.pageType] === undefined) {
				error = 'The page [' + controller.pageType + '] has not been loaded for Controller[path=' + controller.path + '].';
			} else if (typeof app.pages[controller.pageType].model !== 'object') {
				error = 'Error - The [model] property for page object [' + controller.pageType + '] must be a valid JavaScript Object.';
			}
    - The new validaiton needs to be tested and will have to use hash routing to check the view after hash change for the errors

*) DataFormsJS Object
    *) app.addPage("name", callback)
        if function is passed then it will create page as
            { model:{}, onRendered:callback }
        similar to how [app.addPlugin()] works with a callback function
    *) More HTML defaults for things such as [app.settings.defaultRoute]?
        document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-show-errors')
    *) app.routeMatches() should not match "/" to [data-route="/:count"]
    *) Need a redirect function, currently using this in one of the demos:
        app.addController({ path:"/", onBeforeRender:function() {
            window.location.hash = "#/20";
        }});
        * Something will need to be fixed now since ":lang" will be used
        on the main site
    *) Add [app.settings.fetchOptionsByHostName] which will be similar
        to [requestHeadersByHostName] and add a related [getFetchOptons()]
        function that will be similar to [getRequestHeaders()].

*) Page [entryForm]
    *) Add support for radio input controls
    *) Add support for additional [data-type] values
    *) Keep [Save] button disabled if there are no changes
        Try adding this first as a seperate plugin
    *) <input type="file"> likely to be handled with various plugin options and example server code
        see the image classification demo for now
    *) Add validation options to highlight invalid controls
    *) Possibly here or in [plugins/listEditor.js] add a [saveFormat] option with values such as
        "all-records" or "changes-only". Variaous Server Side code examples need to go with it

*) Control [json-data]
    *) Nested templates are currently not supported, does it make sense to support?
        See example in [examples\places-demo-hbs.htm]

*) Plugin [clickUrlAction]
    *) Add options for showing loading or indicator, etc or a or callback for user to handle
    *) If a new page is loaded before this service downloads then don't write back to active model
        To start a simple currentUrl <> previousUrl can be used
    *) Action "refresh-html-controls" should also support an optional [data-controls-selector]

*) Control [data-table.js]
    Add support for [col-link-template] and [col-link-fields] just like is used in the Web Components.
    This may remove the need for a custom plugin used in [examples\places-demo-js.htm], however
    the root [i18n_Locale] variable will have to be figured out how to add it.

*) Extension validation
    *) Many more validations needed including all HTML standard attributes such as <input pattern>

*) Improvements for [app.showErrorAlert()] to show all errors as a list?
    For example keep adding errors to a <ul> control and allow user to clear them.

*) Unit Test all Possible Errors
    For example a specific plugin that throws an exception from [onRendered()]

*) New Unit Test Page to Test Controls, Plugins, etc when not using Single-Page-App (Controllers)

*) Support Built-In Timers for both Controller and Controls?
    data-refresh-time-interval="1000"
    Currently [refreshTimeInterval] is avaialble on the [json-data] Control
*) Handlebars Helpers
    - Make sure all helpers are tested - examples of needed [nlbr, yesNo, yesNoNull]
    - More testing of different languages, etc
    - Test all options for ifCond
    - 'join' function to work on array properties

*) Low Priority - Make main site features work with Polyfill Service when using older IE, Known requirements:
    IE 10: Element.prototype.dataset
    IE 9: console,console.log
    IE 8: Array.prototype.forEach,Event,Event.hashchange,Object.keys,console,console.log
    IE 7: Array.prototype.forEach,Event,Event.hashchange,Object.keys,console,console.log,document.querySelector

    - Currently IE 7 (and probably 8) will be broken unless the last comma "," is removed from the final
       property in an object or item in a list. IE 8 will add an extra [undefined] item while IE7 won't
       parse the script. Related option for eslint. If supporting down to IE8 in the future then update core
       file only for this option. This will not be published though but rather if old IE can work then
       it can be documented.
          /* eslint comma-dangle: ["error", "never"] */

    - Currently the polyfill service has a bug where [Element.prototype.dataset] is not being returned
      when using IE 10.

    - Typically (as of 2019) almost no one uses old IE however older corporate intranet sites often target
      older versions of IE using <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE9">
      Modern apps can be linked via <iframe> however they have to work with old IE to do so.

    textContent needed from here:
    http://eligrey.com/blog/post/textcontent-in-ie8/

    Also related if using HTML:
    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.js"></script>
    <script src="js/polyfill-textContent"></script>
    <![endif]-->

    polyfill.io v2 supports older versions of IE compared to v3; for example [hashchange] is
    supported in IE 6 using v2.
